Each player controls multiple characters. They are called operators. Even the characters that Overwatch controls are operators. Your Overwatch will tell you how many operators you will have in your team.

When creating an operator, the first step is to select a species. It will determine the base characteristics such as movement speed, innate toughness and much more. 

Then, you must select a background. This determines the type of training that operative has gone through. Perhaps also their past life prior to the missions they will live through.

Finally, you must purchase the equipment that the operative has at the beginning of your adventure. Restrictions on the budget and equipment one operator may take will be indicated as you select that operator's species and background.

Give it a name and then your operative is complete!

## Progression

Operators progress through the adventures they experience and activities they partake between the operations. Field experience tends to yield better results but may incur negative results while activities between operations are less efficient but never yield negative results.

Another way to progress is to obtain better or alternate gear. Since equipment have a different level of quality, it's a no-brainer that the most elite soldiers should have the best weapons as they grow in experience.
