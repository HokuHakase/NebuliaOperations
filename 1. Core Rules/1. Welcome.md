Nebulia Operations is a mix of tabletop RPG and wargame. Each player builds a team of characters and go into missions. Between the missions, you may improve your characters and plan ahead.

With the players, there is Overwatch, a person who oversees the missions and act for the opponents. They are akin to a Game Master in a tabletop RPG. As the Overwatch, your goal is to build a coherent plot for your players to experience.

The game can be played with just one player and the Overwatch. It can even be played with only one player and the enemy characters are controlled by a set pre-determined actions.
