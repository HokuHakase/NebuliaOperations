Weapons are the main tool for the operators in Nebulia Operations. Each operator must have at least one weapon.

# Weapon Characteristics
## Range
The distance from the attacker where the weapon is the most efficient. It can be either a distance (e.g. 4), a range (inclusive, e.g. 3-6) or "Melee" (The target must be adjacent to the attacker).

Except for "Melee", the range value does not mean that the attacker can't target enemies outside the range value. It means that any target outside the range value will be harder to hit. This is to represent weapons being too large to fire at close range or the projectile losing power over long distances. This will be explained later in the combat rules.
## Accuracy
The value that the attacker must match or roll lower on a D10 for the attack to hit. A higher accuracy means a higher chance to hit. Rolling a 1 always hits. Rolling a 0 always fails.
## Damage
When the defender fails their armor roll, they lose an amount of defense equal to the damage value of the selected weapon.
## Abilities
Weapons can have one or more abilities that alter its rules. Those are indicated here.
