Nebulia Operations uses the following tool during a battle.

# For everyone
## 10-face die
Shortened as "D10" throughout the rules, this is the only type of die required to play Nebulia Operations. Everything from rolling to hit, performing a skill check or damage will use one or multiple D10.
## Operative tokens
Some form of token should be used to represent the various operatives in the battle. They can be flat tokens just as much as miniatures. Since any distance are always calculated horizontally, there is no difference if a token is 2d or 3d.
## Operator sheet
Each operators have a sheet containing all their information. When creating your operatives, take an operator sheet and fill out the information. That sheet will get updated as the operative evolves.

# For the Overwatch
## Mat with square tiles
Operatives and terrain are placed on a grid of square tiles. When moving, calculating range and so on, the values are in tiles.
## Terrain
Terrains are 2d cutouts. Top-down views of various obstacles like sandbags, building roof, etc. Terrain populates the battlefield for operatives to use a cover and creating variety when moving around. There should not be several floors on one tile.
